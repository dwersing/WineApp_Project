To do:

1.  Set up authentication for users
1A.  Also set up a cookie type idea to stay logged on.

2.  Require unique (not used) username

3.  Set up the "Forgot Password" function

4.  Double check all queries are parameterized

5.  Make entries highlighted as you tab to them for easy erasing

6.  The cursor closes after each use of the app.  I think moving the conn and db variables outside of global would fix
    that.  Maybe just set them to a variable like "params" and call that variable with each query to fix it.

7.  Check for close  spellings if not correct and make sure extra spaces, tabs, etc after the word are not a problem

6.  Generally add more design and color to make it a better looking app to the front end user
